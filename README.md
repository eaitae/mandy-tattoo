# Mandy Tattoo Professional Website

Welcome to the repository for the Mandy Tattoo Studio. This project has been developed using Next.js, a React framework, and styled with the utility-first framework, Tailwind CSS. I personally crafted all the copywriting and design to ensure a cohesive and authentic feel throughout the project.

## Features

1. **Responsive Design**: The landing page is fully responsive across all device sizes.
2. **Original Copywriting**: Every word is meticulously chosen and crafted by me.
3. **Unique Design**: The design of the landing page was made by me exclusively for this project. 
5. **SEO Optimized**: Harnessing the power of Next.js, the landing page is search engine friendly.

## Live Website

The project has been deployed using Vercel and is accessible at [https://mandytattoo.com.br/](https://mandytattoo.com.br/).
